# EZFulfill
Python application using Django and the Shopify API. Takes a .csv file as input, and fulfills orders on the User's Shopify store according to a few user choices. 


The notes in this project are a history of the projects development process. We initially wanted to use a large web framework like Django, however when we began exploring our options we found that a private application did not need such a large framework or so many tools.
