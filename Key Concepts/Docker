Docker

Containerized solution to software programs: more lightweight than a VM, Allows programs to have their own isolated: CPU, memory, block, I/O, and network resources.
	> Does not run duplicate instances of the same OS
	> Does not run redundant boot volumes

Typically a good solution for applications with web-scale requirements.

Containers:

cgroups - control groups: Govern isolation and usage of system resources between programs.

namespaces - Govern resource isolation for a single process.
